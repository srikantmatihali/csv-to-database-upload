"66","0","What is surprising about Peter O'Donnell's investment in UT-Austin?","65","1","<p>IN 2002, Mr. Jackson, an oilman and geologist, left his entire estate worth $232 million to his alma mater, the School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin). The estate is now worth over $330 million. Before this he had gifted over $40 million to UT-Austin. The late Mr. Jackson never thought this bequeath a donation to the university, but an investment for the future of Texas and in the younger generation. His passion to learn about the earth that gave him so much wealth and his tremendous pride in his alma mater were reflected in this gift.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, his gift to UT-Austin is not unusual in the U.S. academic world. Peter O&#39;Donnell, an investor and Wharton School of Business alumnus, envisioned an advanced research group in computational sciences at the intersection of mathematics, science, and engineering to approach science through modelling and simulation. He wanted the best facilities to be established at UT-Austin. The university leased him a piece of land on which he built a state-of-the-art facility at a cost of $30 million and then gifted it to UT-Austin. He never studied at UT-Austin! The benefits of this interdisciplinary research area had no immediate benefit to Mr. O&#39;Donnell. But, he recognised the profound impact it will have on pushing the frontiers of knowledge to solve complex problems computationally, such as developing new composite material, and studying sound waves and underground fluid behaviour. In 2001, colleges and universities in the U.S. raised over $24 billion from individuals, foundations, and corporations. Hewlett and Packard &mdash; co-founders of Hewlett Packard Corporation &mdash; family and foundations have given over $800 million to Stanford University alone. Not to be left behind, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, gave a startling $600 million gift to the California Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>The above gifts are an exception only from the point of dollar figures, but not in the spirit of giving by the hundreds of thousands of individuals and businesses. It is not necessary to be very wealthy to make a difference; thousands of alumni collectively can make a difference. That&#39;s why the total endowment of the top 50 universities in the U.S. is over $160 billion (almost a third of India&#39;s GDP)! Harvard University tops the list with $22 billion followed by Yale ($12.7 billion), Princeton ($10 billion), Stanford (9.92 billion), and UT system (9.4 billion). The dream of all these endowments is to make a better future for the next generation, promote excellence, leave a lasting legacy, and simply give back to the school or community that has given them so much. The culture of supporting educational institutions is deep-rooted in the American psyche. If the U.S. is the land of opportunity and innovations, it didn&#39;t happen accidentally. It has been carved and etched over 300 years by the likes of John Harvard, Leland Stanford, Johns Hopkins, Andrew Carnegie, and Elihu Yale, whose generous gifts created universities in their names, and recently by individuals like Gordon Moore, Hewlett, Packard, Jackson, and O&#39;Donnell. In the early 20th century, Andrew Carnegie, the steel magnate, gave away much of his wealth of nearly $400 million for education and knowledge creation.</p>

<p>Each and every day, new ideas and innovations take shape in U.S. university labs in nanotechnology, bio-informatics, and fuel cells. Corporate America and the world are ready to explore and exploit the innovations and talent. So when we marvel at the Google or Yahoo! search engines, we have to marvel at the research environment at Stanford that provided an opportunity for the founders of these companies to conceptualise, and experiment with, new ideas (incidentally, Stanford received stock and royalties from Google since the technology was developed when its founders were at Stanford). When we think of the Internet, thank U.S. universities for the enormous brainpower and resources committed since the late 1960s.</p>","2","1","3","Peter O'Donnell never studied at UT-Austin.","He built a state-of-the-art facility at a cost of $30 million and then gifted it to UT-Austin.","The benefits of the interdisciplinary research area had no immediate benefit to Mr. O'Donnell.","Surprisingly enough, his gift to UT-Austin is not unusual in the U.S. academic world.","1","b992e290d8c54bd1a7c19eb54a965faa","0000-00-00 00:00:00","1"

What does this statement imply?","65","2","<p>IN 2002, Mr. Jackson, an oilman and geologist, left his entire estate worth $232 million to his alma mater, the School of Geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin (UT-Austin). The estate is now worth over $330 million. Before this he had gifted over $40 million to UT-Austin. The late Mr. Jackson never thought this bequeath a donation to the university, but an investment for the future of Texas and in the younger generation. His passion to learn about the earth that gave him so much wealth and his tremendous pride in his alma mater were reflected in this gift.</p>

<p>Surprisingly enough, his gift to UT-Austin is not unusual in the U.S. academic world. Peter O&#39;Donnell, an investor and Wharton School of Business alumnus, envisioned an advanced research group in computational sciences at the intersection of mathematics, science, and engineering to approach science through modelling and simulation. He wanted the best facilities to be established at UT-Austin. The university leased him a piece of land on which he built a state-of-the-art facility at a cost of $30 million and then gifted it to UT-Austin. He never studied at UT-Austin! The benefits of this interdisciplinary research area had no immediate benefit to Mr. O&#39;Donnell. But, he recognised the profound impact it will have on pushing the frontiers of knowledge to solve complex problems computationally, such as developing new composite material, and studying sound waves and underground fluid behaviour. In 2001, colleges and universities in the U.S. raised over $24 billion from individuals, foundations, and corporations. Hewlett and Packard &mdash; co-founders of Hewlett Packard Corporation &mdash; family and foundations have given over $800 million to Stanford University alone. Not to be left behind, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, gave a startling $600 million gift to the California Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>The above gifts are an exception only from the point of dollar figures, but not in the spirit of giving by the hundreds of thousands of individuals and businesses. It is not necessary to be very wealthy to make a difference; thousands of alumni collectively can make a difference. That&#39;s why the total endowment of the top 50 universities in the U.S. is over $160 billion (almost a third of India&#39;s GDP)! Harvard University tops the list with $22 billion followed by Yale ($12.7 billion), Princeton ($10 billion), Stanford (9.92 billion), and UT system (9.4 billion). The dream of all these endowments is to make a better future for the next generation, promote excellence, leave a lasting legacy, and simply give back to the school or community that has given them so much. The culture of supporting educational institutions is deep-rooted in the American psyche. If the U.S. is the land of opportunity and innovations, it didn&#39;t happen accidentally. It has been carved and etched over 300 years by the likes of John Harvard, Leland Stanford, Johns Hopkins, Andrew Carnegie, and Elihu Yale, whose generous gifts created universities in their names, and recently by individuals like Gordon Moore, Hewlett, Packard, Jackson, and O&#39;Donnell. In the early 20th century, Andrew Carnegie, the steel magnate, gave away much of his wealth of nearly $400 million for education and knowledge creation.</p>

<p>Each and every day, new ideas and innovations take shape in U.S. university labs in nanotechnology, bio-informatics, and fuel cells.
